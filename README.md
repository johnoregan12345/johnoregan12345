Currently studying an online Level 8 course with the Atlantic Technological University (ATU) in Galway. Expect to graduate in September 2025 with a Higher Diploma in Science in Software Development and am interested in finding a suitable entry-level position. Have all the basics of computer hardware/software and can be trained to do any entry-level job. Also, at 61 years old Iâ€™ve got a wealth of life experience and wisdom not to be found in your average graduate. Great fun to be around and work well as part of a team. So can fit into almost any department structure or software development environment.
